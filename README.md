## Minecraft Server Optimizations Repository

Welcome to our open-source Minecraft server optimizations repository! This collection of configurations and settings is designed to enhance performance across our infrastructure, ensuring all players experience smooth gameplay without compromising server stability.

### About This Repository

We've carefully curated optimization settings for various Minecraft server implementations that we use throughout our hosting platform. These configurations are battle-tested and continuously refined to deliver the best possible experience.

### Using Our Optimizations

When creating a server through our Dashboard, you can choose whether to apply our recommended optimizations. This option is available to all users and gives you control over your server's configuration.

### Contributing

Have suggestions to improve our optimization settings? We welcome your input!

- Submit a pull request with your proposed changes
- Include benchmarks or evidence showing the benefits of your optimization
- Explain the reasoning behind your suggested modifications

### License

This repository is available under the MIT license. If you operate a hosting service, you're welcome to incorporate these optimizations into your own infrastructure.

## Credits

The optimization changes implemented in this project are inspired by various guides, carefully modified and curated to ensure the best configurations for a seamless experience. Below are the resources that served as the foundation for these optimizations:

- [YouHaveTrouble's Optimization Guide](https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization)
- [Paper-chan's Optimization Guide](https://paper-chan.moe/paper-optimization/)
- [Celebrimbor's Optimization Guide](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/guide-server-optimization%E2%9A%A1.283181/)

Each of these guides has been meticulously reviewed, and only the most effective configurations have been selected to enhance server performance while maintaining gameplay quality.
